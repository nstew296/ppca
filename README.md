ppca_em.py provides a Python implementation of the EM algorithm for PPCA, combined with an EM algorithm for imputing missing values.

test_ppca.py sets up three simulations to test the EM algorithm for PPCA: one with no missing values, one with values missing completely at random, and one with values missing not-at-random.
